# Combot Project

This project aims to provide endpoints for developers in the Tekken community. As well as being a standalone application.
Thanks to "pbruvoll" over at the rbnTekkenFrameData for the collection! Hopefully will end up merging this project with theirs and contribute to the upcoming Tekken 8 collection.

## Installation

Just have python and pip installed then,

```
git clone <HTTPS/SSH/CLI>		# Clone this repo with your preferred method
cd path/to/repo/Combot 		  	# Change your working directory to the repo
python -m venv <environment_name>	# Make a virtual environment, name can be what you want just update the .gitignore
source <environment_name>/bin/activate	# Activate the venv (for windows use activate.bat)
pip install -r environment.yml		# Use pip to install the dependencies from the YAML file
```

## Usage

The usage is always changing for now, though main.py should be the driver

```
python main.py <args>
```
